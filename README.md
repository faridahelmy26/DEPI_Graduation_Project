Problem Statement
Users often struggle to locate specific resources within Hugging Face documentation due to the sheer volume of 
available information. Our chatbot aims to streamline this process.

We developed a conversational chatbot that leverages the LLama 3.1 model, fine-tuned for optimal performance.
The chatbot guides users in finding relevant information from Hugging Face documentation with an accuracy of 92%.

Unique Value Proposition
Our chatbot combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with natural language processing (NLP) to deliver
precise, context-aware responses, making Hugging Face resources more accessible and user-friendly.
